# Prerequisites
#
# The uts/Makefile defines build parallelism for arm platforms such that
# armv6, and arm are all built in parallel. This requires building certain
# parts before the parallel build can start. The uts/Makefile appends the
# '.prereq' string to the original target and executes this Makefile to build
# any prerequisites needed before the full parallel build can start. After
# that make continues with normal targets.
#
# Any build prerequisites for arm builds should be described here.
#
# genassym is used to build arm/dtrace and genunix, so it should be built
# first.
#
# priv_const.c is required to build genunix.
#
# genunix is used by everyone to ctf-merge with. Genunix is CTF-merged with
#   arm/ip so as a side effect this dependency builds arm/ip as part of the
#   prerequisites.
